    This function computes the Expected SHD between a posterior approximation
    given as a collection of samples from the posterior, and the ground-truth
    graph used in the original data generation process.

    Parameters
    ----------
    posterior : np.ndarray instance
        Posterior approximation. The array must have size `(B, N, N)`, where `B`
        is the number of sample graphs from the posterior approximation, and `N`
        is the number of variables in the graphs.

    ground_truth : np.ndarray instance
        Adjacency matrix of the ground-truth graph. The array must have size
        `(N, N)`, where `N` is the number of variables in the graph.

    Returns
    -------
    e_shd : float
        The Expected SHD.
